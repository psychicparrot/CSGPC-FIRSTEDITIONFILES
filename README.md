# CSGPC-FIRSTEDITIONFILES
C# Game Programming Cookbook for Unity (First Edition) Example files. As these files are now almost 7 years old (as I write this) I won't be updating them any more. They are provided here for reference, but most likely won't be easily converted to run in the latest version of Unity due to the retirement of the old GUI system.

These files are to accompany the book:

LOOK OUT FOR THE SECOND EDITION, COMING IN MARCH 2021 FROM ROUTLEDGE / CRC PRESS.
The 2nd edition features all new example games and an updated framework more suited to Unity 2020 and beyond.
